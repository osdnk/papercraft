# Ringtail

This is a pure Rust implementation of Papercraft, a practical VDF from Lattice-based assumptions.

The codebase is an auxiliary material to the S&P 2025 work _Papercraft: Lattice-based Verifiable Delay Function Implemented_ by Micha≈Ç Osadnik, Darya Kaviani Valerio Cini, Russell W. F. Lai and Giulio Malavolta.

**WARNING:** This implementation is an academic proof-of-concept prototype, has not received careful code review, and is not ready for production use.
